# Dmusik
Dmusik is a music support Dapp that helps in the supporting of artists through the blockchain. This dapp is built with deezer and celo technology combining the two to form a fast song access with free preview of the song before supporting. Also it comes with a like system to vote up the song or search result from deezer. For demo and codebase, refer to the GitHub repo below. Thanks.
